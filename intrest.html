            <h2>Video Games</h2>
            <p>Video games have always been a hobby of mine as they are a great way to spend my free time since it allows me to connect with my friends that are far away as well as develop specific skills. (The game above is the first game I ever played Terraria)</p>

            <h2>Fitness</h2>
            <p>Fitness is a big part of my life, here at boulder I participate in many Intermural Sports like soccer and pickleball as well as try to get in the gym as much as possible! The picture above is my friends and I after climbing the Manitou Incline.</p>

            <h2>Snowboarding</h2>
            <p>Growing up in Colorado I have snowboarded since I was a child. To this day I love to get up on the mountain as much as possible, some of my favorite places to board are Copper, Winter Park, and Crested Butte!</p>
