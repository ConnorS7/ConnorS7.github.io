                Hi! My name is Connor Short, I was born and raised here in Colorado and currently I am a Junior in the Computer Science program 
                here at the University of Colorado Boulder. I have a passion for both the technological and natural aspects of life, for as long as I can remember 
                I have always been facinated by comupters and how they do what do while also being very involved in sports and getting outdoors. This portfolio is 
                here for the readers (you) to learn a bit more about who I am and dive into what makes me, me! You can find my intrests, projects I have completed 
                in my career in tech, resume, and socials by navigating to the pages at the bar above.
